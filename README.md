### Project Structure

The repository contains several C source files, each implementing a specific mathematical operation:

1. add.c: Performs addition of two numbers.
2. multiply.c: Multiplies two numbers.
3. factorial.c: Computes the factorial of a number.
4. cuberoot.c: Calculates the cube root of a number.
5. derivative.c: Computes the derivative of a mathematical function.
6. logarithm.c: Calculates the logarithm of a number.
7. prime.c: Checks if a number is prime.
8. gcd.c: Computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
9. lcm.c: Computes the least common multiple of two numbers.

Each file contains a `main()` function that prompts the user for input, performs the respective operation, and displays the result.

### Functionality Overview

1. Arithmetic Operations: The programs handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and logarithmic calculations.
2. Factorial & Cube Root: Functions like `factorial.c` and `cuberoot.c` provide specialized mathematical computations.
3. Prime Checking: The `prime.c` file includes logic to determine the primality of a number.
4. GCD & LCM: The `gcd.c` and `lcm.c` files implement algorithms to compute the greatest common divisor and least common multiple, respectively.
5. Derivative Calculation**: `derivative.c` offers a basic approach to compute the derivative of a function.
